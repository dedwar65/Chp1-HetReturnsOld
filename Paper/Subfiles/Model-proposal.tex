\subsection{Defining the stochastic income process}

\par Each household's income $(y_t)$ during a given period depends on three main factors. The first factor is the aggregate wage rate $(W_t)$ that all households in the economy face. The second factor is the permanent income component $(p_t)$, which represents an agent's present discounted value of human wealth. Lastly, the transitory shock component $(\xi_t)$ reflects the potential risks that households may face in receiving their income payment during that period. Thus, household income can be expressed as the following:

$$ y_t = p_t \xi_t W_t . $$

%\par The level of permanent income for each household is subject to a stochastic process. In line with \cite{mf1957}'s description of the labor income process,

\par I assume that the level of permanent income for each household follows a geometric random walk:

$$ p_t = p_{t-1} \psi_{t}, $$

\par The white noise permanent shock to income with a mean of one is represented by $\psi_t$, which is a significant component of household income. The probability of receiving income during a given period is determined by the transitory component, which is modeled to reflect the potential risks associated with becoming unemployed. Specifically, if the probability of becoming unemployed is $\mho$, the agent will receive unemployment insurance payments of $\mu > 0$. On the other hand, if the agent is employed, which occurs with a probability of $1 - \mho$, the model allows for tax payments $\tau_t$ to be collected as insurance for periods of unemployment. The transitory component is then represented as:

\begin{equation*}
\xi_t =
    \begin{cases}
        \mu & \text{with probability $\mho$,} \\
        (1-\tau_t) l \theta_t & \text{with probability $1-\mho$,}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\par where $l$ is the time worked per agent and the parameter $\theta$ captures the white noise component of the transitory shock.

\subsection{Baseline model for households}

\par In the baseline version of the household's optimization problem for consumption-savings decisions each household aims to maximize its expected discounted utility of consumption $u(c) = \frac{c^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}$ by solving the following:

$$ \max \mathbb{E}_t \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(\cancel{D}\beta)^{n} u(c_{t+n}). $$

\par The sequence of consumption functions $\{c_{t+n}\}^{\infty}_{n=0}$ associated with a household's optimal choice over a lifetime must satisfy\footnote{Here, I denote $a_t$ as assets, $m_t$ as market resources (or cash-on-hand), $k_t$ as capital, and $\daleth = (1 - \delta)$ as the depreciation factor for capital. Each of the relevant variables have been normalized by the level of permanent income ($c_t = \frac{C_t}{p_t}$, and so on). This is the standard state-space reduction of the problem for numerical tractibility.} 

\begin{eqnarray*}
  v(m_t) &=& \max_{c_t} u(c_t(m_t)) + \beta \cancel{D} \mathbb{E}_{t}[\psi_{t+1}^{1-\rho}v(m_{t+1})] \\
  &\text{s.t.}& \\
  a_t &=& m_t - c_t(m_t), \\
  k_{t+1} &=& \frac{a_t}{\cancel{D}\psi_{t+1}}, \\
  m_{t+1} &=& (\daleth + r_t)k_{t+1} + \xi_{t+1}, \\
  a_t &\geq& 0.
\end{eqnarray*}
