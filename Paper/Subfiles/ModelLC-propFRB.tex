\section{Incorporating life cycle dynamics into the model}
\notinsubfile{\label{sec:Model}}

\par More realistic assumptions regarding the age and education level of households can have important implications for the income and mortality process of households. Here, I extend the model to incorporate these life cycle dynamics.

\par Households enter the economy at time $t$ aged 24 years old and are endowed with an education level $e \in \{D,HS,C\}$, and initial permanent income level $\textbf{p}_0$, and a capital stock $k_0$. The life cycle version of household income is given by:

$$ y_t = \xi_t \textbf{p}_t = (1 - \tau) \theta_t \textbf{p}_t, $$

where $\textbf{p}_t = \psi_t \bar{\psi}_{es} \textbf{p}_{t-1}$ and $\bar{\psi}_{es}$ captures the age-education-specific average growth factor. Households that have lived for $s$ periods have permanent shocks drawn from a lognormal distribution with mean $1$ and variance $\sigma^{2}_{\psi s}$ and transitory shocks drawn from a lognormal distribution with mean $\frac{1}{\cancel{\mho}}$ and variance $\sigma^{2}_{\theta s}$ with probability $\cancel{\mho} = (1-\mho)$ and $\mu$ with probability $\mho$.

\par The normalized version of the age-education-specific consumption-saving problem for households is given by

\begin{eqnarray*}
  v_{es}(m_t) &=& \max_{c_t} u(c_t(m_t)) + \beta \cancel{D}_{es} \mathbb{E}_{t}[\psi_{t+1}^{1-\rho}v_{es + 1}(m_{t+1})] \\
  &\text{s.t.}& \\
  a_t &=& m_t - c_t, \\
  k_{t+1} &=& \frac{a_t}{\psi_{t+1}}, \\
  m_{t+1} &=& (\daleth + r_t)k_{t+1} + \xi_{t+1}, \\
  a_t &\geq& 0.
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{Results}

\par The additional parameters necessary to calibrate the life cycle version of the model are given in table \ref{tab:calib2}.

\par The estimation procedure finds this optimal value to be $\Rfree = 1.0626$ for the R-point model in this setting. The estimation procedure for the R-dist model in the life cycle setting finds optimal values of $\Rfree = 1.0395$ and $\nabla = 0.0737$. Notice the improved performance of the estimation in matching the data displayed in figure \ref{fig:LCUnif}.
